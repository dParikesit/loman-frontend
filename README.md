# Loman | Front-end

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are
treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)
instead of React pages.

## Project Structure

- `components/` - Contains frequently used components on the page
- `context/` - Contains React context to use across component
- `lib/` - Helper functions
- `public/` - Contains icon and static content
- `pages/` - Contains all page and api
- `styles/` - Contains global styling and variables
- `constants/` - Contains constant variable and also stub data
- `test/` - Contains test configurations, although there is no test yet
